# Bayesian networks in Python

This is an unambitious implementation of Bayesian networks in Python. For serious usage, you should probably be using an established framework such as [PyMC](https://docs.pymc.io/), [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/), or [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/).

## Installation
